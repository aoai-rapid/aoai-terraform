Here's a simple script to launch a "Hello World" Docker container:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Pull the official "hello-world" Docker image
docker pull hello-world

# Run the "hello-world" container
docker run hello-world
```

This script does two things:

1. It pulls the official "hello-world" image from Docker Hub.
2. It runs the "hello-world" container.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, for example, `run_hello_world.sh`.
2. Make the script executable with the command: `chmod +x run_hello_world.sh`.
3. Run the script with: `./run_hello_world.sh`.

When you run this script, Docker will download the "hello-world" image if it's not already on your system, then run the container. The container will print a hello message and some additional information about Docker, then exit.

**Note**: that you need to have Docker installed and running on your system for this script to work. If you don't have Docker installed, you'll need to install it first.
